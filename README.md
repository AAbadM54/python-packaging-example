# A Python packaging example

This repository can be downloaded and used as the basic structure for OKFN python projects. It provides the basic requirements for creating a py2/3 universal package.

Use in conjunction with [Python Packaging User Guide][]'s [Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects][].

Pay careful attention to the contents of `setup.py` to ensure your project is configured correctly, and remove sections not relevant to your project.

A minimal `compat.py` module is included to help projects maintain py2/py3 compatibility. Add further compatibility code to it within your specific project.
